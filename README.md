# About
Career Foundry Data Analysis portfolio project focusing on Instacart Data using Python

# Instacart
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.

# Objective
- Clean and merge four datasets (orders, products, department, customer data).
- Analyze data to answer marketing and sales questions (e.g., peak hours, loyal customers, product price categories).
- Analyze data to identify ordering habits based on user characteristics (region, income, loyalty, family size).
- Create customer profiles based on variable combinations and propose targeted marketing strategies.

# Data
We were provided with datasets that contained all the customer information:

- Orders
- Orders_Products_Prior
- Products
- Customers
- Departments
# Folders
The Instacart analysis was separated into the following folders:

- Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
- Data: Categorized into "Original Data" and "Prepared Data," representing the raw data frames and the data frames that have undergone cleaning and preparation for analysis, respectively. Please note that this folder has been not been included.
- Scripts: Contains all the Python code and Jupyter Notebooks used for the project
- Analysis: Comprises the visual representations utilized for deriving insights and showcasing them in the final report.
- Sent to client: Contains the Final Excel Report
